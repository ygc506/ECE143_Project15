#Team 15 Project Proposal: the United States health rankings system 
##Problem:
Analyzing the overall life expectancy based on the gender, age and disease across 51 states in the United States
##Dataset:
World health rankings website:
(https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/usa-cause-of-death-by-age-and-gender)
The entire data are from the public website (shown as above), which contain the death rate, the causes of disease, gender, and the age for different states in the USA. 
Proposed Solution and Real-world Application :
We are all afraid of death, we can find a better way to avoid death by analyzing the data. Our proposed solution is to use a python package (BeautifulSoup) to extract data from the websites (shown above), and build up the overall health ranking system across 51 states. Firstly, we organize the data according to gender, ages, and states.  Then we are going to visualize the data by showing the number of deaths vs. different causes.
Our system can provide health advice to people who input their location, age, and gender.
